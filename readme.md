# jQuery Caret [![NPM version](https://badge.fury.io/js/jquery-caret.svg)](https://www.npmjs.org/package/jquery-caret)

**This is a fork of jQuery Caret with few fixes published to npm for our own convenience. Feel free to use though we probably aren't going to support it much.**

## API
- get the caret's position: `pos = $(textarea).caret()`
- set the caret's position: `$(textarea).caret(pos)`
- set the caret's position to the end: `$(textarea).caret(-1)`

Return value: the current/new caret position
